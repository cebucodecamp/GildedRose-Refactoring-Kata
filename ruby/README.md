## Better ruby

I made this minor changes, so it has the following:

- Uses MiniTest, the de facto test framework in Ruby these days
- Can be invoked by Rake, so no need to manually call on ruby ...

I am also hoping, this will become a starting point for our community
at Cebu Code Camp, to collaborate on expanding this refactoring
practice.
